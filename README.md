# Better Hub

Re-imagining code collaboration — a better place to collaborate on code, for humans and agents.

## Why

At Better Auth, we spend a lot of our time on GitHub. So we decided to build the experience we actually wanted. Better Hub improves everything from the home page to repo overview, PR reviews, and AI integration — faster and more pleasant overall.

## Features

- **Repo overview** — cleaner layout with README rendering, file tree, activity feed
- **PR reviews** — inline diffs, AI-powered summaries, review comments
- **Issue management** — triage, filter, and act on issues faster
- **Ghost (AI assistant)** — review PRs, navigate code, triage issues, write commit messages (`⌘I` to toggle)
- **Command center** — search repos, switch themes, navigate anywhere (`⌘K`)x
- **CI/CD status** — view workflow runs and compare across branches
- **Security advisories** — track vulnerabilities per repo
- **Keyboard-first** — most actions accessible via shortcuts
- **Browser extension** — adds a "Open in Better Hub" button on GitHub pages (Chrome & Firefox supported)

## OCI Image (GHCR)

This repo publishes a multi-arch OCI image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) to GitHub Container Registry.

- Image: `ghcr.io/better-auth/better-hub`
- Tags:
     - `latest` on pushes to `main`
     - branch/tag refs (for example `main`, `v1.2.3`)
     - `pr-<number>` for pull request builds
     - `sha-<commit>`

Pull and run:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/better-auth/better-hub:latest
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file apps/web/.env ghcr.io/better-auth/better-hub:latest
```

The image is configured entirely at **runtime** via environment variables — no
rebuild needed. In particular, `GITHUB_HOST` is read on the server at request
time and injected into the client, so the same prebuilt image works against
GitHub.com or a GitHub Enterprise instance. (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_HOST` is only
needed if you build the image yourself and want the value baked into the bundle.)
